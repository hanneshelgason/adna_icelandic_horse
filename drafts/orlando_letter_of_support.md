Dear Members of the Evaluation Committee,

I am writing in strong support of the application submitted by **Dr Sigríður Sunna Ebenesersdóttir** for a Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship (MSCA-PF) to be hosted at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse (CAGT), University of Toulouse, under my supervision.

**My background and the host institution**

I am a CNRS Silver Medal laureate and founding director of the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse (CAGT) at the University of Toulouse, France. My research group specialises in the genomics of ancient and modern horses, with key publications in *Nature*, *Science*, and *Cell* on horse domestication, breed history, and the genomic consequences of selective breeding. We have developed one of the world's largest ancient horse imputation reference panels, comprising over 900 modern and ancient horse genomes from across Eurasia, which serves as the comparative backbone for international studies of horse diversity and evolution.

**My relationship with Dr Ebenesersdóttir and the existing collaboration**

Dr Ebenesersdóttir and I are already active scientific collaborators. Together with colleagues at deCODE Genetics and the University of Iceland, we have co-authored a manuscript currently under review — [Ahmed et al., title, journal] — which analyses patterns of horse genetic diversity shaped by different breeding traditions within and outside Asia. This collaboration has given me direct insight into Dr Ebenesersdóttir's capabilities as a researcher: her technical command of ancient DNA methods is exceptional, her analytical rigour is evident, and her ability to work across institutional and national boundaries is a significant asset.

**The proposed project**

The project Dr Ebenesersdóttir proposes — a genome-wide reconstruction of the ancient Icelandic horse using aDNA from archaeological specimens spanning 1,100 years — is an outstanding scientific opportunity that I am delighted to support. The Icelandic horse is one of the only domestic animals in the world with a clean, uninterrupted and well-documented population history from the Viking Age to the present, maintained through one of the oldest livestock import bans in recorded history. This makes it a uniquely powerful system for studying the genomic consequences of long-term isolation, founder effects, and selective breeding in a domestic species.

Dr Ebenesersdóttir brings precisely the expertise needed to realise this project: she and her team at deCODE Genetics have developed and applied aDNA extraction and sequencing protocols specifically optimised for degraded Icelandic skeletal material, achieving results that are directly applicable to horse remains. Her landmark study of 88 ancient Icelandic human genomes (*Science*, 2018) demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed approach. My laboratory will contribute the horse genomics expertise and the comparative reference panel required for the imputation and population-level analyses.

**What CAGT will provide**

Dr Ebenesersdóttir will be hosted in my research group at CAGT, where she will have access to:

- Our ancient horse imputation reference panel (>900 genomes) and all associated bioinformatic pipelines
- State-of-the-art computational infrastructure for large-scale genomic analyses
- A highly international and multidisciplinary research environment with expertise in archaeogenomics, biostatistics, and ancient horse genomics
- Regular one-to-one supervision and participation in group meetings, journal clubs, and CAGT seminars
- Support for training in horse-specific genomic methods, including imputation-based analysis, selection scans, and trait-associated variant identification
- Networking opportunities through CAGT's extensive international collaborations and conference participation

I will personally ensure that Dr Ebenesersdóttir has the support, resources, and scientific environment needed to complete this project and to develop her independent research profile during the fellowship.

**Conclusion**

Dr Ebenesersdóttir is an outstanding scientist at a critical stage in her career. She combines deep technical expertise in ancient DNA with a track record of high-impact publications and the rare ability to build and lead collaborative research programmes. The project she proposes is scientifically compelling, timely, and highly feasible. I give this application my full and enthusiastic support, and I look forward to welcoming her to Toulouse.

Yours sincerely,
