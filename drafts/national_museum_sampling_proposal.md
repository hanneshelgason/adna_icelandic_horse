## 1. Introduction

We are writing to request permission to take small destructive samples from a set of archaeological horse remains held at the National Museum of Iceland (Þjóðminjasafnið) for ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis. This request extends our existing collaboration with the Museum, under which permission was previously granted to sample 22 horse specimens from the settlement era. We are now applying for a Marie Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship (MSCA-PF) from the European Commission to carry out a comprehensive genomic study of the Icelandic horse, and we wish to include a broader temporal and geographic range of specimens to maximise the scientific scope of the project.

The proposed study will produce the first genome-wide reconstruction of the Icelandic horse's evolutionary history, tracing the founding of the population, its demographic changes over 1,100 years, and the genomic consequences of more than a millennium of geographic isolation. We believe this research will be of significant scientific and cultural value to Iceland and to the broader international community of researchers working on horse domestication, Norse history, and island biogeography.

## 2. Scientific Background and Rationale

The Icelandic horse is one of the most genetically isolated domestic animal populations in the world. Horses were first brought to Iceland by Norse settlers in the late 9th century CE, and their descendants are thought to have remained separated from all other horse breeds since the establishment of one of the world's oldest livestock import bans, introduced around the 10th century CE. Despite this uniquely continuous and documented lineage, the ancient genetic history of the Icelandic horse is virtually unknown.

Our research group at deCODE Genetics has extensive experience in recovering and analysing ancient DNA from Icelandic skeletal material. In a landmark study published in *Science* (Ebenesersdóttir et al. 2018), we successfully generated genome-wide data from 88 ancient Icelandic human individuals using the same methods we now propose to apply to horse remains. More recently, we have expanded this dataset to 201 ancient Icelandic human genomes spanning 870–2000 CE (manuscript in preparation). The aDNA extraction and sequencing pipelines developed in our laboratory at deCODE have been shown to perform exceptionally well on degraded Icelandic skeletal material, including specimens over 1,000 years old.

The proposed work will be conducted in collaboration with **Professor Ludovic Orlando** at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse (CAGT), University of Toulouse, France. Prof. Orlando is one of the world's foremost experts in ancient horse genomics, having published key studies in *Nature*, *Science*, and *Cell* on horse domestication and breed history. His laboratory has developed a reference panel of over 900 modern and ancient horse genomes, which will be used to impute and analyse the ancient Icelandic horse genotypes recovered in this study. Prof. Orlando and our research group are already active collaborators: we are co-authors on a manuscript currently under review on horse genetic diversity across Eurasia.

## 3. Research Objectives

This project has three specific aims:

**Aim 1**: Reconstruct the genomic ancestry and demographic history of ancient Icelandic horses, identifying the founding populations, the number and timing of introduction events, and demographic changes over 1,100 years.

**Aim 2**: Identify the Scandinavian and Eurasian genetic origins of the Icelandic horse by comparing ancient Icelandic horse genomes with ancient and modern horses from Scandinavia, continental Europe, and the Eurasian steppe using imputation-based comparative analysis.

**Aim 3**: Assess the genomic impact of long-term geographic isolation, including levels of inbreeding, signatures of adaptation to Iceland's environment, and the prevalence of disease-related and trait-associated genetic variants.

To achieve these aims, we aim to sequence up to **90 ancient Icelandic horse specimens** spanning the settlement period (ca. 870 CE) through to the late 19th or early 20th century, providing a temporal transect of the population's evolution under isolation.

## 5. Sampling Methodology

All sampling will be carried out by Sigríður Sunna Ebenesersdóttir or under her direct supervision. We use the same minimally destructive approach successfully applied to the 22 previously sampled Icelandic horse specimens and to over 200 Icelandic human skeletal specimens.

**Material requested per specimen**: Approximately 50–100 mg of cortical bone powder, obtained by drilling or surface scraping of a non-diagnostic, non-visible area of the bone. For teeth (the preferred substrate), we sample the root or an internal section of the crown. For loose bone assemblages, we will select the most morphologically redundant element available.

**Surface decontamination**: All bone surfaces are cleaned with a low-speed drill prior to sampling to remove potential modern contamination. Sampling is carried out under conditions that minimise environmental contamination.

**Documentation**: All sampling actions will be documented with photographs before and after, and a written sampling report will be provided to the Museum upon completion.

We do not require whole bones or teeth to be removed from the Museum. All work can be performed on-site at the Museum, or samples can be taken as small amounts of bone powder using a hand-held drill, leaving the specimen otherwise intact.

## 6. Laboratory Analysis

All aDNA work will be performed at the dedicated ancient DNA clean-room laboratory at deCODE Genetics, Reykjavík, which was established and is maintained by the applicant. This facility is physically isolated from areas where modern DNA is handled, and follows strict contamination-control protocols standard in the field of ancient genomics.

The analytical pipeline involves:
- DNA extraction using silica-based methods optimised for degraded skeletal material
- Illumina sequencing library preparation with unique molecular indexing
- Sequencing on Illumina platforms (NovaSeq or HiSeq) at deCODE Genetics
- Read mapping to the horse reference genome (EquCab3)
- Genotype imputation using the Orlando laboratory reference panel (>900 horse genomes)
- Population genomic analyses: ancestry estimation, demographic modelling, selection scans

Samples that yield insufficient endogenous DNA (below approximately 1%) will be excluded from further analysis, and no additional material will be consumed beyond the initial extraction.

---

## 7. Data Management and Dissemination

All genomic data generated in this study will be deposited in an appropriate public repository (e.g., European Nucleotide Archive, ENA) upon publication, in accordance with open data principles and FAIR data standards. We commit to sharing data with the Museum and making the results freely available to Icelandic researchers and the public.

We commit to the following upon completion of the study:

- Providing the Museum with a written summary of results for each specimen sampled
- Acknowledging the National Museum of Iceland in all publications arising from this work
- Informing the Museum in advance of any publications and providing copies
- Consulting the Museum regarding any public communication about the finds

---

## 8. Ethical and Legal Compliance

This research involves skeletal remains of domestic animals (horses) and does not raise issues of human biological material or personal data. The research will be conducted in compliance with applicable Icelandic law and with the ethical guidelines of the institutions involved (deCODE Genetics, University of Iceland, University of Toulouse).
