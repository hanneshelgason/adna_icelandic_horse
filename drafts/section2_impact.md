## 2.1 Academic Impact

This project will make contributions to several active research fields.

**Ancient horse genomics and domestication science**

Recent breakthroughs in ancient horse genomics — including the identification of the Pontic steppe as the origin of modern domestic horses around 4,200 years ago (Librado et al., *Nature* 2021) and the characterisation of global breeding traditions through time (Ahmed et al., under review) — have relied on geographic breadth and temporal depth of sampling. The North Atlantic has been a significant blind spot: no ancient genomic data exist for horses from Iceland, Greenland, or the Norse Atlantic world. This project fills that gap, adding a dataset of 90 ancient Icelandic horses to the global record and enabling, for the first time, formal inference about which horse populations were selected and transported during the Norse expansion.

**Island biogeography and the genomics of isolation**

The genomic consequences of long-term founder effects and geographic isolation in domestic species are poorly understood, largely because clean, well-documented examples are rare. The Icelandic horse — isolated for over 1,000 years with a near-complete historical record — is an exceptional model for quantifying these effects. The results will be directly relevant to evolutionary biology, conservation genetics, and the study of other island-isolated livestock and wild populations. The temporal transect design of this project, tracking genomic change from founding to the present, provides a level of resolution unavailable from modern-only datasets.

**aDNA methodology**

The project will advance methodological standards for ancient DNA analysis of non-human vertebrates in low-latitude island environments, where preservation conditions differ from the permafrost contexts in which many prior studies have been conducted. The imputation framework to be applied — combining low-coverage ancient genomes with a large modern reference panel — builds on approaches validated for human aDNA (GLIMPSE2) and extends their application to horses. Validated pipelines and data will be made openly available, benefiting the broader field.

**Norse history and Viking Age studies**

The Icelandic horse is a direct biological record of Viking Age mobility and animal husbandry. The ancestry of founding horses — from Scandinavia, the British Isles, or both — will directly inform debates about the composition of Norse settlement parties, the scale and selectivity of animal transport during the landnám, and the cultural significance of specific horse lineages. Comparison with samples from Orkney, Shetland, and potentially Greenland (via collaborators Dr Sophie Newman, University of Edinburgh, and contacts at the Universities of Copenhagen including Prof. Tom Gilbert and Prof. Eske Willerslev) will allow us to trace horse movement networks across the Norse Atlantic world.

## 2.2 Societal and Economic Impact

**The Icelandic horse industry**

The Icelandic horse is a living cultural and economic resource of considerable scale. There are approximately 80,000–100,000 registered horses in Iceland and over 100,000 in other countries, making it one of the most internationally distributed native breeds in the world. Breeding associations in Iceland, Germany, Scandinavia, and North America invest significantly in maintaining the breed's genetic integrity and health. Results from this project will directly benefit these communities by:

- Providing the first population-level baseline of genomic diversity from which current genetic health can be assessed
- Identifying historical variants associated with heritable conditions — including sweet itch (Culicoides hypersensitivity), equine metabolic syndrome-like profiles, and ocular conditions — that can inform modern selective breeding strategies
- Clarifying the genomic basis of the tölt and pace gaits (DMRT3 variants), traits of central importance to breed identity and competitive use

**Cultural heritage and public engagement in Iceland**

The Icelandic horse occupies a unique place in Icelandic national identity and cultural heritage. The results of this project — reconstructing the founding of the breed in the Viking Age, tracing its evolution, and characterising its distinctive adaptations — will be of broad public interest. We will engage with Icelandic public audiences through deCODE Genetics' established public communication channels, media partnerships, and existing collaborations with the National Museum of Iceland, which holds the archaeological specimens at the heart of this project.

**Animal health and conservation genomics**

The identification of genomic variants that have increased in frequency under isolation — including potentially deleterious recessives — has direct applications beyond Iceland. The approach developed here can be applied to other isolated or endangered domestic and wild animal populations, informing conservation breeding programmes worldwide.

## 2.3 Dissemination and Communication Plan

**Scientific publications**

We anticipate the following publications arising from this project:

1. *Primary research article* — Ancient genomics of the Icelandic horse: founding, demography, and 1,100 years of isolation. Target journals: *Nature Genetics*, *Current Biology*, *PNAS*, or *Molecular Biology and Evolution*.
2. *Research article* — Genomic signatures of adaptation and trait evolution in the isolated Icelandic horse lineage. Target: *Genetics* or *Molecular Ecology*.
3. *Methods contribution* — if the imputation pipeline for ancient horse genomes is substantially extended, we will publish the methodological advance separately.

Preprints will be posted to bioRxiv prior to journal submission. All publications will be submitted to open-access journals or made available via open-access routes.

**Conference presentations**

Results will be presented at leading international conferences in the field, including:
- International Symposium on Biomolecular Archaeology (ISBA)
- Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution (SMBE) annual meeting
- International Society for Animal Genetics (ISAG)
- Viking-age and Norse history symposia (e.g., the International Saga Conference)

**Public engagement**

- Public lecture at deCODE Genetics, Reykjavík (established public science communication tradition)
- Engagement with Icelandic media (television, radio, print) — previous deCODE publications on ancient Icelandic genomics have received substantial national and international media attention
- Contribution to National Museum of Iceland outreach on Viking Age Iceland
- Social media communication via CAGT and deCODE channels
- Summary reports provided to the National Museum of Iceland and to Icelandic horse breeding associations upon project completion
