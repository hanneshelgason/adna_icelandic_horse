# Sunna's Task List
## Things only you can answer or do

This is Phase 1 work — none of the drafting can start until these are resolved.

### Questions to answer (put notes in `specs/project_concept.md`)

1. **The three aims** — Do the three aims as written reflect your vision? Anything missing, wrong, or that you'd frame differently?

SSE Answer: This looks like a good start.

2. **Sample numbers** — How many samples are realistically available and sequenceable? We have 7 with existing libraries (VHR031 etc.) and a long list from the National Museum. What is a credible number to promise in the application (e.g., "up to 30 ancient samples spanning 870–1900 CE")?

SSE Answer: 50 from the settlement era (870-1100 CE) and 40 from 1100-1900 CE. 

3. **Orkney / Greenland** — Is there a realistic path to getting comparative samples from Orkney or Greenland? Do you have contacts?

SSE Answer: We might get samples from Newark in Orkney through an ongoing collaboration (remind me to give you the names and institution later, one is Dr Sophe Newman, School of History, Classics and Archaeolgy, University of Edinburgh); we already human samples from pre-Christian burial sites from Newark. We have contacts in Denmark that might be able to get us samples from Greenland (Tom Gilbert and Eske Willerslev).

4. **National Museum access** — Has permission been granted or sought for new sampling? Who is the contact curator?

SSE Answer: Permission has already been granted for 22 samples from the settlement era, but we have been promised to get the remaining samples. The curator is Joe Walsher III. Could you write a proposal for further sampling at the National Museum of Iceland (Þjóðminjasafnið) -- the proposal should be in English?

5. **Orlando** — Have you spoken to him about this fellowship? Is he committed to hosting, and when can you get a letter of support?

SSE Answer: It is in progress -- Agnar Helgason, my previous supervisor, and I, have done him a lot of favours and sequenced aDNA
samples for him in the past -- it is very unlikely that he will not be committed to host but we need to get a letter of support. This is a task for me to do. Could you draft a letter that he can use as a starting point and sign?

6. **The DMRT3 / health story** — Do you want Aim 3 to focus on the health/disease angle, the gait/functional adaptation angle, or both equally? This affects tone significantly.

SEE Answer: Both equally. I need further background. Although I am an expert in aDNA (fullstack from sampling, library prep, bioinfo pipeline building and running large scale computations, mapping sequencing reads, variant calling, downstream statistical analysis, population structure insights, scientific writing, scientific communication), it has up until now mainly been on human samples. I have all the technical skills for dealing with these samples. I have access to an aDNA lab that I set up personally at deCODE genetics Iceland.

7. **Fellowship timing** — When would you realistically start? The fellowship is for 24 months. Does September 2026 deadline/2027 start work for you?

SSE Answer: I'm currently looking for a job. I have an adjunct professorship at the University of Iceland, but need to find a longer term solution and funding. So the earlier, the better. In the plan, could you write down some of the critical timelines.

### Things you need to provide

8. **Section brief notes** — Once you're happy with the aims, fill in the bullet points in:
   - `specs/section_briefs/excellence.md`
   - `specs/section_briefs/impact.md`
   - `specs/section_briefs/implementation.md`
   These are short notes (a few bullets each) telling Claude what to emphasise when drafting each section.

9. **Ahmed et al. status** — What is the current review status of the horse diversity paper? Has it been peer-reviewed? This affects how we cite it in the application (under review vs. accepted).

10. **deCODE data access** — The application will likely reference access to deCODE's comparative genomic data (modern Icelanders etc.). Is this something you can formally state in the application?

### Things Hannes Helgason will handle

- Formatting guidance and MSCA application structure
- Section review and feedback once drafts are ready
