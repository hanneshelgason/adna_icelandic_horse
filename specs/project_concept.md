## Working Title
Ancient horse genomics of Iceland: reconstructing the founding, breeding history, and demographic fate of the Icelandic horse

---

## Core Narrative

The Icelandic horse is one of the most genetically isolated domestic animal populations in the world. Since Norse settlers brought horses to Iceland in the late 9th century, the population has remained separated from all other horse breeds by one of the world's oldest livestock import bans (~10th century CE). Despite this unique continuous lineage, the population's ancient genetic history is virtually unknown.

Previous work by Pálsdóttir et al. provided the first archaeological and genetic insights into early Icelandic horses, but at insufficient sequencing depth for population-genetic analyses. No high-coverage genomic study has yet reconstructed how early horse populations formed, diversified, and adapted to the island environment following settlement.

This project will apply advanced aDNA protocols — established in our laboratory and proven on Icelandic human remains (Ebenesersdóttir et al., Science 2018) — to horse specimens from archaeological contexts across Iceland. These optimised extraction and sequencing pipelines provide exceptional efficiency for highly degraded material. The work will be conducted in collaboration with Dr Ludovic Orlando at CAGT, University of Toulouse, whose group has developed one of the world's largest ancient horse imputation reference panels (>900 modern + ancient genomes) and recently used it to characterise global horse diversity.

## Why Sunna + Orlando

**Sunna brings**:
- aDNA protocols proven on highly degraded Icelandic skeletal material (Science 2018, 201 ancient genomes)
- IBD analysis, population genomics, imputation (GLIMPSE2), PCA, ADMIXTURE
- Access to Icelandic horse specimens through deCODE and the National Museum of Iceland
- Existing sequencing libraries for 7 horse samples (VHR031, VHR085, VHR089, VHR093, VHR100, VHR102, VHR105)

**Orlando brings**:
- World-leading expertise in ancient horse genomics (Nature, Science, Cell)
- Horse-specific imputation reference panel (>900 genomes) for comparative analysis
- Established methodology for imputing low-coverage ancient horse genomes

**Pre-existing collaboration**:
Ahmed, Renaud, Moore, Ebenesersdóttir, …Helgason, Orlando (under review). "Different breeding traditions shaped horse genetic diversity within and outside Asia." — This paper demonstrates both the scientific connection and the working relationship between Sunna and Orlando.

## Sample Numbers
- **Settlement era (870–1100 CE)**: up to 50 specimens
- **Post-medieval (1100–1900 CE)**: up to 40 specimens
- **Total**: up to 90 ancient Icelandic horse specimens

Existing sequencing libraries already available for 7 samples (VHR031, VHR085, VHR089, VHR093, VHR100, VHR102, VHR105). 22 further specimens already permitted by the National Museum; sampling proposal submitted for the remainder.

## Three Specific Aims

### Aim 1 — Reconstruct genomic ancestry and demographic history of ancient Icelandic horses

Generate genome-wide aDNA data from archaeological horse remains spanning the Icelandic settlement period (9th–11th century CE) and later medieval contexts. Using the same high-efficiency extraction and sequencing methods as Science 2018, obtain coverage sufficient for imputation and population-genomic analyses. Identify founding populations, determine whether horses arrived in one or multiple introduction events, and reconstruct demographic changes over 1,100 years (founder effect analysis).

### Aim 2 — Identify Scandinavian and Eurasian genetic origins via comparative imputation

Use Orlando's imputation reference panel (≥900 modern + ancient genomes) to impute ancient Icelandic horse genotypes to high density. Compare with ancient and modern horses from Scandinavia, continental Europe, and the Eurasian steppe. Reveal precise ancestral components that formed the Icelandic horse and clarify its place within the global network of horse domestication and medieval mobility.

### Aim 3 — Assess the genomic impact of long-term geographic isolation

Test how ~1,000 years of isolation shaped levels of inbreeding, genetic drift, selection, and disease-related variants. Identify genomic regions showing signatures of adaptation to Iceland's climate, terrain, and husbandry practices. Evaluate how isolation has affected health resilience or vulnerability.

## Broader Scientific Value

1. **A globally unique test case for long-term isolation in domestic species** — The Icelandic horse is one of the only domestic animals with a clean, uninterrupted population history from the medieval period to the present without foreign admixture. This provides a rare natural experiment for studying the genomic consequences of isolation, long-term founder effects, genetic drift, and island adaptation.

2. **Insights into Viking Age animal husbandry and Norse mobility** — What animals were moved during the Norse expansion? Were breeding stock transported selectively? How did horses reflect cultural identity in the Viking World? The Icelandic horse becomes a biological marker of Norse migration. Potential for comparison with Orkney/Greenland samples.

3. **Contributions to global horse domestication science** — Adds high-quality ancient genomes from a previously unstudied region; fills a critical geographic gap in North Atlantic horse history; enables imputation-based reconstructions of medieval breeding strategies; tests hypotheses about European vs. Asian horse divergence.

## Known Genetic Traits and Health Relevance (for Aim 3)

| Trait | Notes |
|---|---|
| Sweet itch (Culicoides hypersensitivity) | Very common in exported Icelandic horses; genetic predisposition suspected |
| Metabolic conditions / EMS-like profiles | "Easy keeper" trait; possible adaptation to low-calorie winters |
| Ocular conditions (uveitis) | Evidence for higher frequency in isolated breeds |
| DMRT3 gait variants (tölt and pace) | Selective sweep; not a disease but key to functional adaptation in Iceland |

## Key Finding from Ahmed et al. (Under Review)
The Ahmed et al. manuscript (Sunna co-author; Orlando co-corresponding) establishes that the **NORD genetic ancestry** — the primary ancestry component of Icelandic horses — emerged around **~810 CE, coincident with the Viking era**. This is a powerful framing hook for the application: the founding of the Icelandic horse population is directly linked to the Norse expansion, and our project will be the first to trace this genomically from the inside. The same imputation reference panel (901 modern + 376 ancient genomes) used in Ahmed et al. will be applied to ancient Icelandic horse specimens in this project.

## Open Questions

- Can we obtain samples from Orkney or Greenland for comparative analysis?
- How many founding animals? (founder effect quantification)
- Confirm access to National Museum samples (curator contact needed)
- Confirm letter of support from Orlando
- Consider including modern Icelandic horse genomes for temporal comparison
