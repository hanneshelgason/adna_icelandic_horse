## Task List

### Background reading
- [ ] Read Ahmed et al. manuscript (`background/Ahmed_et_al/Ahmed-20260128-Manuscript.docx`) — understand scope, methods, and how Sunna's role is framed
- [ ] Review mergeInfofreeze data (`background/mergeInfofreeze_horsesIceland.xlsx`) — understand existing library coverage and sequencing stats for the 7 horse samples
- [ ] Review `background/summary_sites_120625.docx` — understand the archaeological context and site coverage
- [ ] Identify the two unlabelled papers (`1746-6148-7-21.pdf`, `1471-2156-7-46.pdf`) and add them to `specs/scientific_background.md`

### Resolve open questions (Sunna + Hannes)
- [ ] Confirm commitment from Orlando: letter of support timeline
- [ ] Confirm access to National Museum samples: has permission been sought?
- [ ] Determine whether Orkney or Greenland samples can be obtained for comparative analysis
- [ ] Confirm how many existing sequencing libraries there are in total (check the Excel vs. the email from Sanne)
- [ ] Identify target MSCA-PF 2026 call text — download and review evaluation criteria

### Finalise project concept
- [ ] Review and approve `specs/project_concept.md` (Hannes + Sunna)
- [ ] Confirm the three aims as written, or revise
- [ ] Agree on a final working title
- [ ] Add expected outputs: number of samples to sequence, target coverage, publications planned

### Write section briefs
- [ ] `specs/section_briefs/excellence.md` — instructions for drafting Section 1
- [ ] `specs/section_briefs/impact.md` — instructions for drafting Section 2
- [ ] `specs/section_briefs/implementation.md` — instructions for drafting Section 3

### Read example applications
- [ ] Extract key structural and stylistic patterns from ROOTS (2008), CARIB (2013), and THAIS (2022)
- [ ] Note: what makes these applications strong? What framing works well?
