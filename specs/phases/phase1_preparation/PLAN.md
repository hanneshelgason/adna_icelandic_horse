# Phase 1 — Preparation

**Goal**: Assemble and understand all background material; resolve key open questions; finalise the project concept; write section briefs so Claude can begin drafting.

## Task List

### Background reading
- [x] Read Ahmed et al. manuscript — 901 modern + 376 ancient horse genomes; NORD ancestry (Icelandic horses) emerges ~810 CE (Viking era); imputation panel is what the MSCA project will use; Sunna is co-author; G. Renaud (also on paper) was himself a Marie Curie fellow
- [ ] Review mergeInfofreeze data (`background/mergeInfofreeze_horsesIceland.xlsx`) — needs Excel reader; confirm library coverage for 7 existing samples
- [x] Review `background/summary_sites_120625.docx` — site descriptions for the Iceland2 *human* manuscript; confirms Sunna's aDNA track record across Iceland
- [ ] Identify the two unlabelled papers (`1746-6148-7-21.pdf`, `1471-2156-7-46.pdf`) and add them to `specs/scientific_background.md`

### Resolve open questions (Sunna + Hannes)
- [x] Confirm commitment from Orlando — in progress; Sunna to follow up; draft letter prepared (`drafts/orlando_letter_of_support.md`)
- [x] Confirm National Museum access — 22 samples already permitted; sampling proposal for remaining specimens drafted (`drafts/national_museum_sampling_proposal.md`); curator is Joe Walsher III
- [x] Orkney/Greenland comparative samples — Newark Bay, Orkney via Dr Sophie Newman (Univ. Edinburgh); Greenland via Tom Gilbert and Eske Willerslev (Copenhagen)
- [ ] Confirm exact library count and coverage from mergeInfofreeze Excel
- [ ] Download MSCA-PF 2026 call text and evaluation criteria — Sunna/Hannes to action

### Finalise project concept
- [x] Review and approve `specs/project_concept.md` — Sunna: "looks like a good start"
- [x] Add expected sample numbers — 50 settlement era (870–1100 CE) + 40 post-medieval (1100–1900 CE) = 90 total (updated in project_concept.md)
- [ ] Confirm three aims as final (pending Sunna/Hannes sign-off)
- [ ] Agree on final working title

### Write section briefs
- [x] Stub files created for all three section briefs
- [ ] `specs/section_briefs/excellence.md` — Sunna to fill in key points
- [ ] `specs/section_briefs/impact.md` — Sunna to fill in key points
- [ ] `specs/section_briefs/implementation.md` — Sunna to fill in key points

### Draft application sections
- [x] `drafts/section1_excellence.md` — first draft complete
- [x] `drafts/section2_impact.md` — first draft complete
- [x] `drafts/section3_implementation.md` — first draft complete (Mermaid Gantt)
- [x] `drafts/orlando_letter_of_support.md` — first draft complete
- [x] `drafts/national_museum_sampling_proposal.md` — first draft complete

### Read example applications
- [ ] Extract key structural and stylistic patterns from ROOTS (2008), CARIB (2013), and THAIS (2022) — pending
