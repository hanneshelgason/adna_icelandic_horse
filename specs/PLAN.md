## Key Resources

### People
- **Sunna** — scientific content, sample inventory, access to deCODE data and National Museum collections
- **Hannes** — MSCA application strategy, format guidance, review
- **Ludovic Orlando** — letter of support, host capacity statement, scientific input on horse genomics; co-author on Ahmed et al. (under review)
- **Agnar Helgason** — confirm availability of deCODE horse data

### Key background documents (all in `background/`)
- `icelandic_horse.docx` — early project draft; forms the basis for `specs/project_concept.md`
- `Ahmed_et_al/Ahmed-20260128-Manuscript.docx` — the under-review Sunna+Orlando paper; establishes collaboration and demonstrates feasibility
- `examples/` — three MSCA example applications to use as format and tone guides
- `mergeInfofreeze_horsesIceland.xlsx` — existing Icelandic horse genomic data
- `Horses.docx` + `horse_samples_decode.docx` — sample inventory from National Museum and deCODE

### MSCA Part B-1 structure
- **Section 1: Excellence** (~4 pages): 1.1 Objectives, 1.2 Relation to work programme, 1.3 Methodology, 1.4 Originality and innovative aspects, 1.5 Open science
- **Section 2: Impact** (~3 pages): 2.1 Academic impact, 2.2 Societal/economic impact, 2.3 Dissemination and communication
- **Section 3: Implementation** (~3 pages): 3.1 Work plan / work packages, 3.2 Risk assessment, 3.3 Resources

## Open Questions (to resolve in Phase 1)

- [ ] Can we obtain comparative samples from Orkney or Greenland?
- [ ] What is the current status of access to National Museum samples — has permission been confirmed?
- [ ] Is Orlando committed to hosting? Is a letter of support forthcoming?
- [ ] What is the exact sequencing coverage of the 7 existing libraries (VHR031 etc.)?
- [ ] Is there a specific MSCA-PF 2026 call text we should align to?
