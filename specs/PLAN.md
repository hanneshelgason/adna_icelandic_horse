## Open Questions (to resolve in Phase 1)

- [ ] Can we obtain comparative samples from Orkney or Greenland?
- [ ] What is the current status of access to National Museum samples — has permission been confirmed?
- [ ] Is Orlando committed to hosting? Is a letter of support forthcoming?
- [ ] What is the exact sequencing coverage of the 7 existing libraries (VHR031 etc.)?
- [ ] Is there a specific MSCA-PF 2026 call text we should align to?
